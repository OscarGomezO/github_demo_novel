Chapter 2
=========

Eleven-year-old Rex didn’t have breakfast, instead saving the last of the cereal for his two-year-old brother, Ford, and feels frustrated about being dragged to the grocery store when he never receives any of the food he likes. He reflects on how his entire life has been this way, and how he sometimes gets the urge to fight anyone or anything he can take his anger out on. Luciana yells at Rex as he refuses to get out of the car,
threatening to hit him if he doesn’t listen. In the grocery store, Rex’s stomach growls as he and his mother walk down the aisles. Luciana picks up some rotting ground beef on sale and throws it in the cart despite Rex’s protests. He savors free samples of sausage and mustard. Another sampler tries to deny Rex from taking anything without buying, and Luciana yells at the man, embarrassing Rex. She is still angry when they reach the register, and Rex notices the cashier staring at him.
